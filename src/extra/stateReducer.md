> Your function gets two arguments: 1) the current state of downshift, 2) the upcoming changes. Your job is to "reduce" that to the changes you want to take place. Also, the upcoming changes have a `type` that correspond to the `stateChangeTypes` so you know whether you want your logic to apply. You might think of the `changes` as an "action" in redux (it has a type), but what you return isn't the whole state (like you would in redux), just the changes you want made to the state.
